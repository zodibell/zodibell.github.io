<h3>What is this blog about?</h3>
<p>My writing centers on culture, motherhood, and navigating life as I approach (and embrace) middle age. Although I will always favor analog journals, I think I’ve been using them as a crutch to hide my writing. This is an effort to share my words with the world and to build community, even as isolation and fear plague us.</p> 
<p>If anything here resonates with you, send me an email!</p>
