Bodies keep turning up in the bayous here. 

“City of Houston leaders discussed the issue during a city council meeting this week, but expressed skepticism about the need and potential effectiveness of physical barriers such as fencing. They said alcohol, mental health and homelessness could be contributing factors to the recent deaths.”

Allowables

by Nikki Giovanni

I killed a spider
Not a murderous brown recluse
Nor even a black widow
And if the truth were told this
Was only a small
Sort of papery spider
Who should have run
When I picked up the book
But she didn’t
And she scared me
And I smashed her

I don’t think
I’m allowed

To kill something

Because I am

Frightened
