_Below are some disorganized thoughts I had in response to people acting nervous about that pile of orange excrement removing Juneteenth's official holiday designation._  

Those wretches in DC have no power over the ways we commemorate our ancestors.  
People clearly need reminding: We have acknowledged Juneteenth for generations, without acknowledgement from the federal government or corporate sponsorship. We will continue to do so. Them folks can only gentrify our holiday if we let them. 

- For some background on the history of Juneteenth, [click here to view NMAAHC's digital toolkit](https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/moments/juneteenth/digital-toolkit).  

- Texas is not the only state with an Emancipation Day! I encourage everyone to learn about [your home state’s Emancipation Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Day). It helps us all to understand the slavery & Reconstruction in context, not as a singular event. {% include zb_bloc.html %}  

- You can read [General Order #3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._3) online. I think this is something we should incorporate into our Juneteenth celebrations, along with readings of the [Emancipation Proclamation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation) & the [13th Amendment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). Ponder the implications of each document. 

- Many people don’t know that there are oral history collections that provide firsthand accounts of the experiences of Black Texans. Take a moment to explore them today. [Click here to read about Juneteenth stories in Baylor University's archives](https://bn.web.baylor.edu/news/story/2024/juneteenth-memories-baylors-oral-history-archives).

- Juneteenth is a good time to remember that enslaved people did not passively wait around for proclamations. They resisted in many ways. There are LOTS of books on resistance. [This is just a summary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_rebellion_and_resistance_in_the_United_States).

- For folks who enjoy archival photos, [Texas Highways did a nice Juneteenth piece](https://texashighways.com/travel-news/the-history-of-juneteenth-in-photos/) documenting celebrations over the past 160 years. 

- If you really want to dig into some extensive Juneteenth primary sources, the Library of Congress has a massive archive of interviews from formerly enslaved people. [Here is part of the Texas collection](https://www.loc.gov/item/mesn161/).

As we devolve further into fascist chaos, I encourage us to honor the audacity of our ancestors and devote ourselves to deeper understandings of history and culture. [Make no mistake, they intend to erase and rewrite history to support their agenda](https://www.zinnedproject.org/materials/erasing-history/). It is up to us to ensure they don't.
