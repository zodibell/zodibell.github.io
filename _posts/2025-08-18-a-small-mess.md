Feelings feelings feelings.  
Spilling out my ears,  
Leaking out my eyes,  
Dripping from my fingertips. {% include zb_bloc.html %}  
Should I embrace the kaleidoscopic mess?  
Roll around in it?  
Let the hues adorn me  
Like some wild altar?  
Or clean it up & sit daintily in  
Monochromatic sterile comfort?  
No risk of a stain, but  
Oh, the immersion in all that color would be bliss.  
Or misery?  
How badly do I want to know for sure?  
I’m so good at keeping things clean.  
Maybe, just for a little while, I’ll enjoy the colors pooling around me.  
A small mess can’t stain too badly, right?
