As I type this, the [2025 Met Gala](https://www.vogue.com/tag/event/met-gala) is underway. I know that the Met Gala gives big Hunger Games energy. That analogy is warranted given everything going on in the world. For years after the [Ferguson protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest), I ranted and raved about the gauche display of wealth and leisure while so much was happening politically. I still feel that way generally. But I gave myself permission this year to tune in to the red carpet event with as little guilt as possible. {% include zb_bloc.html %} Not completely guilt-free, mind you. And that's what keeps rolling around in my skull - the betrayal of that bit of myself that "knows better" and agonizes over every innocuous move I make as I survive in this capitalist society. I'm thinking about the various lines we draw as we seek comfort during the collapse. 

Over the last few years, I've become increasingly enthusiastic about textiles and fashion history. To me, the Met Gala is one night where the skills of sewists, embroiderers, haberdashers, tailors, beadworkers, and [all kinds of creators](https://www.vogue.com/article/native-american-designer-met-gala-2024-jamie-okuma) are put on display. The history of the event itself speaks to the way that women's art is devalued [(the Costume Institute was severely underfunded in the 1940s)](https://www.vogue.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-met-gala-video), and the Costume Institute does outstanding work in the field of [conservation](https://www.metmuseum.org/departments/costume-institute-conservation). 

So, at the risk of sounding banal and naive, I‚Äôd like to take a moment to gently remind people that the event really does support artisans, public history, and preservation. It‚Äôs not just about celebrities. (To be honest, I don't know who most of the celebrities are, and half the ones I do know, I don‚Äôt even like. That goes for Ms. Dreadful Bob and that skateboarding rapper.) I know there are people, myself included, who are rightfully pissed at the state of things. But I suppose I'm simply in the mood to give myself a break from righteous anger for an evening. The Met Gala is a big event for folks who are into textiles, handmade clothing, museum funding, etc. It is also a tacky display of wealth and insipid celebrity worship. Right now, in light of the demoralizing layoffs in the arts and humanities, I'm focusing on the craftspeople and preservationists who are having a hard time. This is one of the few events that brings major funding and attention to their work.

I don't believe in re-inventing the wheel, so I'll share the words of the erudite and wonderfully snarky [Derek Guy](https://dieworkwear.com/) here: 

> ["It‚Äôs true that these events often spotlight an absurd concentration of wealth. But IMO, the criticism aimed specifically at the Met Gala reflects a deeper bias‚Äînamely, the belief that anything related to fashion (or even clothing more broadly) is inherently frivolous and undeserving of serious support. I've long said that I think fashion is uniquely disrespected because it has been historically coded as a feminine interest, even if it's at the core of how we broadcast identity (for people of any gender)."](https://x.com/dieworkwear/status/1915887898702057709) ~ April 25, 2025

Not many people consider the fact that preserving textiles is especially difficult work in the world of archives. It's a completely different science from the preservation of oil paintings, for example. The research conducted at the conservation lab helps archivists all over the country to preserve historical garments and other items. You know those [amazing artifacts at NMAAHC](https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/collection) that we all love? They require a lot of care. Museums, archives, & preservation matter! This event helps support that work.

### The Importance of Honoring Black American Culture

I hope tonight‚Äôs [Met Gala theme](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/05/nx-s1-5372642/2025-met-gala-black-dandyism-tailoring-style) encourages people to read up on dandyism and other ways Black people have used fashion to assert personhood, creativity, & liberation in the face of the extreme hate. Research tignon laws, sapeurs, all of it. There‚Äôs a lot to learn. Developing an appreciation for culture and supporting museums/archives is [one way to fight fascism](https://philosophynow.org/issues/129/Can_Art_Fight_Fascism). Indeed, preserving and creating culture helped my ancestors survive chattel slavery and Jim Crow. 

To those who believe that cultural preservation is trivial in the fight for liberation, I say this: Our ancestors endured unspeakable horrors. I will never look down my nose at the skills, traditions, & modes of expression they created to survive the hell that white folks brought upon them. I think it‚Äôs important to remember their struggles AND joy. We are not one-dimensional. One tool of white supremacy is convincing us that our ancestors had no depth, no joy, no connection to their own pasts or to the wider world.

So whenever possible, it is good to remember their humanity. Whether through language, fashion, food, or dance. They fought back with what they had.

Some of the most meaningful work I ever did was recording the stories of Black elders who spoke frankly about the horrors of Jim Crow while *simultaneously* expounding upon the care they took with a well-seasoned pot of beans or the stitching on an Easter dress. Culture did not happen in a vacuum. White people did everything they could to separate them from their humanity, to reduce them to bodies only good for labor. Our ancestors resisted in direct ways [(poisoning)](https://harbingersmagazine.com/articles/herbal-insurgency-wielding-knowledge-to-heal-and-harm-under-southern-enslavement/) & indirect [(the cakewalk)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QifiyNm6jG4). But some folks today are so smug and narrow-minded that they can‚Äôt see why BOTH approaches are important.

Our forebears collectively figured out how to walk & chew gum at the same time. 
To dismiss culture as frivolous is to dismiss the very real work they did to maintain connections with their own children & ancestors. 

The [Stono Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stono_Rebellion) happened in 1739. South Carolina passed the Negro Act of 1740 [(see section 36)](https://wisc.pb.unizin.org/ls261/chapter/ch-1-1-the-slave-code-of-south-carolina-1740/) which, among many things, banned drumming. 

*Drumming.* 

But we still have [hand games](https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2023/10/espn-films-documentary-short-black-girls-play-from-award-winning-directors-joe-brewster-and-michele-stephenson-to-debut-november-12-at-830-p-m/), stepping, the blues, tap-dancing, & jazz. You think that was happenstance? They said screw the law & resisted through culture! Our ancestors, under the threat of torture/death, taught their children how to keep rhythm with their bodies when they couldn‚Äôt use a drum. 

[White folks will carve their forefathers‚Äô faces into mountains](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/rushmore-sioux/), then turn around and tell you that honoring your people‚Äôs cultural expression is vapid. Why? Because if you get to poking around all the ways Black people resisted & persisted, some things might start to shake.
All that to say, I‚Äôm here for the work of the museum (as problematic as it is), the artisans, the opportunity to use the theme to learn about fashion & Black resistance/self-definition.
