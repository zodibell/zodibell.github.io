Bodies keep turning up in Houston's bayous. 

Now, this isn't anything new. [There is a lot of water in Houston](https://stories.uh.edu/magazine/magazine/fall-2023/houston-bayous/index.html), so it is not unreasonable that there are a handful of accidents each year. According to [KHOU](https://www.khou.com/article/news/investigations/houston-bayou-bodies/285-98257436-24a9-4ce2-a04f-340f402e38af), there were 9 bodies found in 2023 and 20 bodies found in 2024. So far this year, there have been 24 bodies. ([Houston Public Media reports slightly different numbers.](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2025/10/08/532888/another-body-found-in-houston-area-bayou-police-confirm/?amp=1)) Only 3 of the bodies found since 2023 were determined to be the result of homicide. 

The problem this year is that there seems to be a marked concentration of bodies recovered since September. On September 15, [the body of a University of Houston student was found](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/houston/2025/09/18/531277/body-of-university-of-houston-student-reported-missing-found-in-brays-bayou/). Since then, [**SEVEN** bodies have been pulled out of the bayous](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2025/10/08/532888/another-body-found-in-houston-area-bayou-police-confirm/?amp=1). I (and many other folks) can't help but wonder about what the underlying cause might be. Seven bodies in about a month easily leads people to [speculate about a local serial killer](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/houston/2025/10/01/532413/how-news-of-houston-bayou-deaths-became-a-serial-killer-conspiracy-theory/?amp=1). I have entertained that possibility myself, especially given the strangeness of the disappearance of the UH student. While the thought of someone attacking people and dumping them in waterways is terrifying, that's not the only aspect of this story that bothers me. 

Authorities {% include zb_bloc.html %} have repeated that there does not appear to be a connection between the bodies recovered recently, and they do not suspect foul play. But even if the bodies found in recent weeks were not the result of homicide, I think the numbers point to a growing need for safety measures along the bayou trails. However, this [is the response](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2025/10/08/532888/another-body-found-in-houston-area-bayou-police-confirm/?amp=1) the community received after asking about fencing, blue light emergency phones, or other precautions:

> “City of Houston leaders discussed the issue during a city council meeting this week, but expressed skepticism about the need and potential effectiveness of physical barriers such as fencing. They said **alcohol, mental health, and homelessness** could be contributing factors to the recent deaths.”

While technically true, there is a dismissive callousness that undergirds this statement. The current mayor has some questionable beliefs about public safety. Last year he implied that a [Kroger grocery store in one of the wealthiest parts of town had a crime problem](https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/kroger-whitmire-crime-houston-19628364.php). He is [anti-pedestrian](https://www.chron.com/culture/article/mayor-whitmire-houston-controversy-19986405.php), among other things. 

It feels like this city's leaders are using "alcohol, mental health, and homelessness" as  reasons to stymie discussions about the bodies in the bayou; As if people dealing with these issues do not warrant the same sense of urgency as others. This disgusts me. Even if these deaths are random and accidental, and even if it is mostly so-called undesirables dying, the Houston community should still care that *something* caused seven individuals to lose their lives in/around the bayous in a matter of weeks. Serial killer rumors aside, city leaders should prioritize an investigation of what might be happening to our vulnerable neighbors experiencing substance abuse, mental illness, or housing issues. 

I am reminded of Nikki Giovanni's poem "Allowables" from her [1968 book *Black Feeling, Black Talk, Black Judgement*](https://archive.org/details/blackfeelingblac00giov/mode/2up):

    I killed a spider  
    Not a murderous brown recluse  
    Nor even a black widow  
    And if the truth were told this  
    Was only a small  
    Sort of papery spider  
    Who should have run  
    When I picked up the book  
    But she didn’t  
    And she scared me  
    And I smashed her  

    I don’t think  
    I’m allowed  

    To kill something  

    Because I am  

    Frightened  

Written at the height of civil unrest and violence in the 1960s, the poem holds relevancy in current discussions of harm done to poor and mentally ill people. We aren't allowed to allow them to die because we are frightened of them or because their presence in our society reminds us of our own fragility within this harmful capitalist system. People are not disposable. 

[Violence against unhoused neighbors often goes unnoticed](https://homelessness.ucsf.edu/blog/violence-against-people-homeless-hidden-epidemic), and I hope no one is running around Houston hurting them because they (perhaps accurately) assume they can get away with it. I hope that safety concerns around the bayous are adequately addressed by the Mayor and City Council as quickly as possible. I hope that more resources are dedicated to serving vulnerable populations in our community. I hope that the families of each of the people pulled from the bayous recently find respite from their grief.
