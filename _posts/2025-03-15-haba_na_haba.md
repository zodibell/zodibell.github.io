One of my favorite Kiswahili proverbs is "Haba na haba hujaza kibaba." It means "Little by little fills the cup/pot." In other words, if you take things one day at a time, you will fulfill your goals. 

I struggle with this. The spectre of perfectionism has haunted me all my life, sabotaging many of my goals. I have trouble pacing myself, as my brain often tells me that if I can't accomplish something amazing in a short amount of time, I can't do it at all. {% include zb_bloc.html %}

I decided a couple of years ago that this mendacity simply cannot follow me into the future. I have learned to force myself to tackle goals that *cannot* come to completion instantly. Building this blog from scratch is one example. Tinkering with code is helping me with my long-term career goals, and it also helps me remove my passive online support of platforms like Substack which uphold some <a href="https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/substack-announcement-bari-weiss-free-press">pretty nefarious stuff</a>. 

My son is teaching me to embody the patient spirit of "haba na haba" as well. Nearly every aspect of raising a tiny human involves delayed gratification. He never gave up as he learned to roll over, hoist himself up on his hands and knees, crawl all over the house, pull up, and walk. It took him from birth to about 10.5 months to take a few steps, and he was so proud of himself at every stage. I recall his tenacity as I re-envision my life. There are no quick fixes. The woman I want to be will be found at the end of a meandering path of small victories. To reach her, I must continue to commit to  disciplined practice, not the high of instant wins. 

The journey is the thing.
